        Follow these steps to start displaying a child location:
        <ol>
          <li>Download Child Locator App on the device in which you want to display a location. From now on
          we refer to it as a <b>parent's device</b>.</li>
          <li>Once the app is opened you should see <button type="button" class="btnFAQ" data-image="main.png">this screen</button>. If it is your first time
          using the app you should create a new account using the <b>create account</b> option. If you already have an account you can <b>use app as parent</b>
          in order to add children and see their location, or <b>use app as child</b> to make a child device share its location and send its data to the
          associated parent device. If it is your first time using the app, do the following:
          <ul>
            <li><b>Create an account:</b> Create an account using the parent's device by filling in the parent data in
             <button type="button" class="btnFAQ" data-image="createAccount.png">this screen</button>. Provide your name, a username for your new account, email address,
             and a new password for the account. You need to have internet access in order to record your account information.
             Email address has to be a valid email address, we will send you an email with a link to activate your account.
             Also, in case of forgetting your password, we can send you a link to your email in order to set a new password.
             Once your account is active by using the link you received in the email you can do the next step.
            </li>
            <li><b>Use app as parent</b>: If you are on the create account screen, go back to the main screen by tapping on the arrow on the top left corner and then tap on <q>use app as parent</q>.
            You will go to <button type="button" class="btnFAQ" data-image="parentLogin.png">this screen</button>. There, you can use your credentials provided when creating an account to
            login into your account. Note that you need to have internet access in order to verify your credentials. Once you login as a parent you should
            see <button type="button" class="btnFAQ" data-image="parentMain.png">this screen</button>. There you can start adding new children by using the
            icon on the right bottom corner. If you tap on adding a child you need to enter the name of the child on
            <button type="button" class="btnFAQ" data-image="addChild.png">this screen</button> and tap on <b>Add</b>. After adding the new child
            you should be able to see the child's name on the screen, which should look like
            <button type="button" class="btnFAQ" data-image="childAdded.png">this screen</button>. There you can tap on the child's name in order to
            set the child's device or display the child's location, it should look like
            <button type="button" class="btnFAQ" data-image="childNew.png">this screen</button>.<br><br>

            As for now, no location should be displayed since we need to install the app on the child's device and
            set it so that it shares the location with the parent's device. We do this in the next step.
            </li>
          </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Once the app is installed on a parent's device and a child has been added there, we need to install the app
          on the child's device. Make sure you have internet access on the child's device and that it has the GPS on.
          After installing and opening the app on the child's device, tap on <b>use app as child</b> on <button type="button" class="btnFAQ" data-image="main.png">this screen</button>.
          After this, you should see <button type="button" class="btnFAQ" data-image="loginChild.png">this screen</button>. In order to proceed you need to
          provide the username and password of the parent account created on the app and the unique token associated to the child that is created
          when a parent adds a new child. You can find this token on the parents device on <button type="button" class="btnFAQ" data-image="childNew.png">this screen</button>
          if you tap on <b>Instructions</b>. After that, you should see
          <button type="button" class="btnFAQ" data-image="childToken.png">this screen</button> in which you can see the
          unique token associated to the child that has to be put when using the app as a child.<br><br>

          If everything worked correctly, after logging in as a child, you should see
          <button type="button" class="btnFAQ" data-image="childMain.png">this screen</button> and you
          can start to see the child's location on the parents device if you tap on the top right corner on the
          box that says <q>Tap here to update location</q>. Once the app gets the child's location, it should be
          displayed on the parent's device as in
          <button type="button" class="btnFAQ" data-image="parentLoc1.png">this screen</button>. There you can navigate
          on the map, zoom in or out and update the location by tapping on the top right corner box. For instance, by
          zooming in you can see more details about the location as in
          <button type="button" class="btnFAQ" data-image="parentLoc2.png">this screen</button>.

        No. Everytime you want to display the location of a child by tapping on <q>Tap here to update location</q> on the
        top right corner of <button type="button" class="btnFAQ" data-image="childNew.png">this screen</button>, the parent's device
        sends a request to the child's device to share its location. Once the location is obtained by the GPS, the child's device will send its location
        only to the parent device that requested the location. Once the location is shown on the app, the app does not store the location.
        All requested locations are only shared with devices that requested such location. As a security measure, each account
        has a private code, only know to the app, which works as a signature to each request. Without such signature, locations are not displayed
        or submited. Additionally, locations are sent through secure channels using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security">TLS protocol</a>.

        If the app is asking for permission to store data, access photos and/or media in your device, probably by seeing
        <button type="button" class="btnFAQ" data-image="permissionData0.png">this screen</button> or
        <button type="button" class="btnFAQ" data-image="permissionData1.png">this screen</button>, is because you are probably
        using the app as a parent and the app needs permission to store data in order to download and save map images
        to display a location. Without this permission location of a child will not be displayed because the app is not able
        to store the needed map images to draw a location on the screen.<br><br>

        In order to show the location of a child, the user has to grant this permission when the app asks for it or
        grant it manually by going to <b>Settings -> Apps -> Child Locator -> Permissions</b> on your device.

        If you are using the app as a child, the app needs access the device location in order to
        send it to a parent device when requested. Usually the app asks for this permission to the user
        when using it as a child as in
        <button type="button" class="btnFAQ" data-image="gps1.png">this screen</button> where you can
        select the appropiate permission. If your GPS is off the app will ask you to turn it on as in
        <button type="button" class="btnFAQ" data-image="gpsOn.png">this screen</button>.<br><br>

        To manually grant/reject location permission to the app you can go to <b>Settings -> Apps -> Child Locator -> Permissions -> Location</b> on your device
        and get a screen like <button type="button" class="btnFAQ" data-image="gpsPermission.png">this screen</button>
        where you can set the corresponding permission.<br><br>

        To manually turn on/off your GPS you can go to <b>Settings -> Location</b> on your device.

        When downloading the app, you have a trial period of 30 days to check its funcitonality and
        it is restricted to display only the location of one child. In case you like the app and would like
        to check more than one location you can subscribe to the service by going on the parent's device
        to the settings menu on the top right corner of
        <button type="button" class="btnFAQ" data-image="childAdded.png">this screen</button> and then select

        The suggested way to stop sharing a location by the app in a child's device is by logging out from it. To do this, you can go to the child's device, open the app and tap
        on <b>logout</b> on <button type="button" class="btnFAQ" data-image="childMain.png">this screen</button> and then
        input your account password on
        <button type="button" class="btnFAQ" data-image="logoutChild.png">this screen</button>. Once the password is verified,
        which requires Internet connection, the app stops the process of getting and sharing a location. We require password verification
        to let parents have control over the app and avoid children to accidentally stop sharing a location from the app.<br><br>

        Note that you can also stop sharing the location of a device by rejecting the location permission granted to the app
        as explained in <b>How to grant/reject location permission to the app?</b> above.

        The location obtained by a device, and therefore the location displayed on the app, could be inaccurate in some cases and this has
        nothing to do with the app but instead with the device and the environment in which is the device is located. An accurate location
        can be achieved with the following
        <ul>
          <li>Set your device to get an accurate location instead of an approximate location: In some devices, you can
          specify this if you go to <b>Settings -> Location</b> to get a screen like
          <button type="button" class="btnFAQ" data-image="locationExample.png">this</button> in which you can select <b>mode</b>
          option and get to
          <button type="button" class="btnFAQ" data-image="locationMode.png">this screen</button> to select a high accuracy location.
         </li>
         <li>Be in an open space, near a window or in a place in which a satellite can determine the position of a device. See <a href="https://www.gps.gov/systems/gps/">the global positioning system (GPS)</a>
           to learn how the positioning system works and <a href="https://www.gps.gov/systems/gps/performance/accuracy/">GPS accuracy</a> to see what
           aspects may affect its accuracy. In particular, <i><q>GPS-enabled smartphones are typically accurate to within a 4.9 m (16 ft.) radius under open sky. However, their accuracy worsens near buildings, bridges, and trees.</q></i></li>
         <li>By making multiple location requests to the app: Once a location is displayed, you can
           request the location again for few more times in order to get a more accurate location.
         </li>
        </ul>
